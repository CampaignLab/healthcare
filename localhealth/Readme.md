* `LocalHealth_All_indicators_Ward_data.xlsb`  
    * From the website, go to the pull-out menu on the left, then "Data download files", then "Ward 2016".
        * There are other files here which I haven't investigated. This seems to be the most fine-grained containing all the data.
    * Contains data for all indicators and all wards.
    * Formatted with one row per data value from the website.
